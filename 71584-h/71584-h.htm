<p>Illustrated by TEMPLE</p>

<p>When on Pru'ut, you must do as the natives<br>
do—and that includes dying as they do!</p>

<hr class="chap">

<p>On the charts, it's P-1345-AZ, and a thin blue line marked with cryptic
letters indicates that a Mallor Lines cargo ship stops three times in
each local year. The Guide will tell you a little more; that it's a
small hot planet, covered with fern forests and swamps, and inhabited
by one of the innumerable primate-human species of the universe. It was
also inhabited, for a while, by one Terran, James Grady.</p>

<p>The natives call it Pru'ut, which, freely translated, means "the
world." They refer to themselves as Kya, which means "people." James
Grady, being a realist, called it the Mudhole, and added a descriptive
adjective or two; but he did not find it nearly as unpleasant a place
as a few others in which he had been in the course of forty years of
wandering.</p>

<p>Pru'ut has no inclination, and only one season, which is rather like a
rainy August on Earth. When Grady arrived, he stepped from the landing
stage of the Mallor Lines' <i>Berenice</i> into six inches of gluey mud; the
sun was seldom out long enough to harden the surface of Pru'ut.</p>

<p>"It's not an easy place," the departing agent, Jansen, told Grady.
"Rain, and heat, and getting along with the locals."</p>

<p>"Anything the matter with 'em?" Grady asked. He was watching the tall,
yellow-pale shapes of natives loading bales into the <i>Berenice's</i> cargo
slings.</p>

<p>"Nothing much," Jansen said. "Sane as any primitives. All kinds of
complicated rules and taboos, and naturally they'll get as mad as hell
at you if you scratch a single rule. Most of the data on that is in
the agent's notebooks. You add anything to the record that seems to be
worth putting down, the way the rest of us have."</p>

<p>"And if they get mad at you, they stop packing plants," the
<i>Berenice's</i> mate put in. "Which will make the Mallor Company mad at
you, too. This place is a regular bargain basement for drug materials.
At least eight different drug plants, all of them worth as much as
uranium. More, in some ways."</p>

<p>"Mm." The ex-agent picked up a handful of brown leaves from a table.
"This, for instance. It's a distant relation of coca. The natives chew
it for fun, but it's the source of a first class anesthetic. And this.
If your kidneys ever break down, the doctors use this stuff to keep
you alive. Kerosin, it's called. Anyway, you'll find price lists and
descriptive material in the files. You've worked for Mallor before,
haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Grady said. "I put in three years on Tengo, in Port City. Then I
quit for a while. Had something else to do."</p>

<p>"Oh? What?"</p>

<p>Grady's face cracked into a slight grin. "Little bit of an argument.
The Mutiny. I joined the local army, if you could call it that. I had
my own gun, so they made me a major on the spot."</p>

<p>"The Mutiny?" The <i>Berenice's</i> mate had heard of that brief and savage
war, in which a handful of settlers and local militia had beaten
off the troops of a powerful state, and had actually won. The mate
hastily readjusted his opinion of Grady upward. A trader's agent was
one thing; a man who had fought through the Mutiny was something more
than that. The mate opened his mouth to ask more of the story; but the
<i>Berenice's</i> air-horn cut him off with a long wail.</p>

<p>"Take-off in twenty minutes," the mate said, as the noise subsided.
"You ready, Jansen?"</p>

<p>The ex-agent nodded, and shook hands with Grady. "Good luck," he said,
and started for the ship, the mate following.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Grady said, closing the door of the agency. He had completely
put the <i>Berenice</i> out of his mind by the time the roar of her
departure split the wet air of Pru'ut. He was, in fact, well on his way
to settling down as a permanent resident by that time.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A year later, the <i>Berenice</i> had called twice, and her captain and mate
were calling Grady by his first name. He had also acquired a native
woman, who, in accordance with one of the innumerable customs, could
not call him by name at all. She referred to him as Kotasa, which is a
sort of title. He, also in accordance with customs, called her Shallra,
which was not her name, but that of her mother. Grady was also
extremely careful not to speak to her mother at all, because of another
custom.</p>

<p>Grady—Kotasa to his wife, and Shassa to the rest of the
village—fitted in well, better than any Terran had until his coming.
Grady had spent most of his life living in odd places and with strange
people; and had come to the conclusion that it was always a good
idea to be a conservative by local standards. He could recall, quite
clearly, the day he had found what was left of Steynert, who had tried
to change the dietary habits of the inhabitants of Kree.</p>

<p>By comparison with the Kree, the Kya were an easy people to get along
with. Their lives were not hard, since Pru'ut was a fertile world, and
full of food sources. The Kya farmed their garden patches, fished, and
hunted, and spent the remaining time gathering plants for Grady and
reciting endless and complex genealogies. Grady paid for the plants
with goods from the trade warehouse, and listened gravely to the
genealogies, making mental notes whenever anything was mentioned that
might be of practical use. He did not consider himself as a collector
of scientific information; he was a practical man, and he selected
information for practical ends.</p>

<p>Shallra was the best wife he had ever had, and Grady had lived
on several worlds. She spoke little, and when she did, it was
direct and to the point. She was affectionate, but, like most Kya,
undemonstrative. She had been brought up to consider that males were
equals, but that certain male privileges, such as the lodge magics and
the use of horn pipes, were inviolable. Grady had lived on one world
where men were considered very much superior to women, and had found
that the attitudes which result are not as pleasant as they might seem.
And lastly, Shallra was probably the best cook on Pru'ut, if not the
best on several worlds.</p>

<p>The Kya generally liked and trusted Grady, and, after two years, he
was almost one of them. Standing on the agency porch, in the weak
sunlight, he seemed to have acquired the same yellowish skin and lean
face, and he was dressed in the same loose kilt. Shallra came out to
stand beside him, and they looked like any other Kya.</p>

<p>"The sun," she said gravely. "There will be a dance tonight."</p>

<p>Grady nodded. "Like to see it," he said. "The dance, I mean."</p>

<p>"It is for men," Shallra said. "Koor," she pointed at the sun, "is a
god belonging to men. The women dance when the sky clears in the night."</p>

<p>"Men's dance, eh?" Grady said, sucking on his pipe. "You're probably
right about it being all right for me to go. But I'd better check with
the Chief anyway."</p>

<p>He started down the log-paved walk, toward the Chief's house on the
other side of the village. He could see it clearly at the far end of
the long, muddy street, but it was necessary to walk along a twisting
detour, rather than directly toward it. There was an acre of ground in
the center of the village, filled with crumbling, empty huts, and no
Kya walked through this ground. It belonged to Sa'ahah, whose ghost
walked in a wide circle around the hut where a jealous rival had
speared him in his sleep.</p>

<p>The house was the usual Kya affair, on tall stilts, with painted
signs on its facade, but much more elaborate as befitted the Chief's
position. He was Anla-Who-Speaks-for-the-Ancestors. There were several
other kinds of chief, but it was Anla whom Grady consulted before
trying anything in the least unusual. Anla sat on his porch now,
regarding the sun through slitted eyes.</p>

<p>Grady greeted him in proper form, and Anla returned the greeting,
rising and bowing.</p>

<p>"Is there any reason why this person may not attend the dance of Koor
with his brothers on this night?" Grady asked.</p>

<p>Anla thoughtfully pulled his lower lip; then, nodding, he said, "No,
there is no reason not to."</p>

<p>Then Grady made the mistake. He made it in full view of Anla's
mother-in-law, who sat peering balefully out from her special room in
the corner of the Chief's house; and of Anla's wife, and of his wife's
innumerable relations, who were clustered on the porch. When Grady saw
their silent staring, he looked down at his feet, and he saw what it
was that he had done. Anla saw it too, and the two men looked up again,
and at each other, very gravely.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Grady did not say he was sorry. It would have been of no use whatever.
Nor did he point out that the sun came out so infrequently that his
mistake was one which could be excused. Among the Kya there are very
few mistakes which can be excused, and stepping on the shadow of a
chief is not one of them.</p>

<p>Neither did Anla make any reference to the long friendship between
them, because there would have been no point in doing so. Anla's eyes
grew darker, and the wrinkles at their corners deepened, but his words
were calm, the correct words for such a time.</p>

<p>"Your name was Shassa," Anla said. "You have broken the ghost-cloak of
the Chief, and your name cannot be Shassa. From this place and this
time I take back your name, Shassa, and you have no name."</p>

<p>Grady did not say anything, because a Kya cannot hear the words of a
man without a name; besides, there was nothing to say, though a great
deal to think about. The <i>Berenice</i> was due in four days. Four days
during which a man without a name would have to avoid the custom which
decreed that such a man must be killed. Killed as soon as possible,
because each day he continued to live was a day which must be removed
from the calendar, a day on which no man's birth date might be
celebrated, or any animal killed for food, or any root taken from a
garden.</p>

<p>Grady turned, and walked slowly, with a stiff back, down the path
away from the Chief's house. To run, or to show fear, would be fatal;
the Kya were themselves in a state of shock at the thing which had
happened, and it would be an hour or more before they began to prepare
for what they had to do. Therefore, Grady held his spine straight,
feeling a cold spot between his shoulderblades where the first
iron-headed arrow might strike in.</p>

<p>Ahead of him, through the village, the silent children ran on light
feet, darting into the houses and out again—the children, who were the
bearers of news. He saw three of them dash toward the agency, and enter
it; and in a moment, as he came up the path, Shallra came out on the
porch, carrying a clay pot in her hands.</p>

<p>"You who were Kotasa," she said, "take this, and drink it to free me of
your name."</p>

<p>It was the standard form of divorce among the Kya, and if the eyes of
Shallra had not been bright with tears, Grady might have slipped. He
took the clay pot, but he did not drink, because he could smell the
faint and bitter odor about it, which was not the odor of the fruit
wine that it should have held.</p>

<p>"Why?" he asked her, quietly.</p>

<p>"Because it is an easier death than the knife and the arrow," she said,
and added, "When you were Kotasa, you were—a good man for me. Drink
the wine." She said it pleadingly. He shook his head.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," Shallra said, and there is nothing harder for a Kya to
say. But she added something even harder for a Kya woman to say; his
name, his proper name, which she had always known but could never use.
Then she walked away, and out of Grady's life, because he was now a man
without a name.</p>

<p>He set the pot down carefully on the agency's steps and went inside. As
he closed the door, there was a high, whistling noise, and a sharp thud
against the door planks. He did not need to look to know that an arrow
stood in its wooden panels.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Grady closed the heavy wooden shutters carefully, not even jumping when
a second arrow whickered through the last shutter as it swung. He lit
a table lamp and took the heavy, seldom-used rifle from the wall. He
did not need to check it; he had oiled and cleaned it once a week for
two years. Instead, he laid it on the table and took a book down from a
shelf.</p>

<p>"General Code of the Federation Authority," Grady read the words on the
spine, and opened it. "Extent of responsibilities of individuals on
mandated planets...."</p>

<p>Under the circumstances, Grady discovered, he could kill any number of
Kya if he were so inclined. The Authority would require a full report,
in quadruplicate, of the circumstances—and as another arrow struck the
door, Grady wondered wryly who would make out that report.</p>

<p>Also, Grady was not in the least inclined to kill any Kya. If doing
so would have saved his life, he would have shot any number of them
without any particular qualms. But there were no reasons at all to
think that killing any of them would do Grady any good. And Grady
thoroughly understood why it was that they had to kill him. He was no
more angry with the Kya than he had been with the Imperial Guards,
five years before, when they had come up Kanno Hill with their band
playing and their bayonets gleaming. He could remember how military
and colorful they had looked, in comparison to the overalled, grimy
rabble who stood beside him; and how they had come up that hill again
and again, fewer of them each time, and the band losing a bit of verve
on the last. Grady's anger then had been at the damned fool, whoever
he was, who ordered those useless charges; and his anger now was with
himself, because it had been his own mistake.</p>

<p>There was a growing murmur outside the agency. The villagers were
gathering in the street, and in the yards behind the building. There
was no way out now, and nowhere to go if there had been a way out.</p>

<p>Grady got up, and walked to the door. He opened the sliding panel a
crack and peered out.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<figure class="figcenter illowp86" id="illus1" style="max-width: 36.125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus1.jpg" alt="">
</figure>

<hr class="chap">

<p>The rain had begun again, and through its thin gray curtain he could
see the ranks of villagers, silent, standing around the house, along
the railings, and watching. The men stood in front, each holding his
weapons, his bow bent in his hands. There was Lahrsha, who had been
brother in the Lodge to Grady, and whose blood had been mixed with
his to seal the tribal bond. There was Ahl, whose small son Grady had
nursed through a bad week. There were Grady's friends and neighbors and
brothers, each with an arrow on the nock for Grady.</p>

<p>"It's a queer thing to happen," Grady said to himself, aloud. The sound
of his own voice startled him; he had become so much a Kya that to him
a man without a name should not have a voice.</p>

<p>The arrows struck oftener now. Grady saw a small group of men move
away, and then return, carrying a short log.</p>

<p>The door, Grady thought. They'll break it down, and come in, with their
grave faces and their polite ways, and they'll cut my throat. And it
won't matter if I kill one or two or ten of them; they'll do it anyway.
They won't hear an argument, because they can't hear me at all, without
a name; they won't even hear any noise I make when they finish me off.</p>

<p>The log had begun to beat against the door, with a steady thunder.
Grady opened a cabinet, and took out a jar of brown liquid. Quickly he
drank it and sat down, his face graying. His head fell forward on his
arms, and the book of regulations fell to the floor, atop the unfired
rifle.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<p>The <i>Berenice</i> swung outward, riding home to port with an empty hold.
The Mallor Company would not be pleased, but there were other jobs. And
the mate, sitting across the messroom table from James Grady, put the
matter in its simplest terms.</p>

<p>"Just one of those things," the mate said. "You can't be blamed.
They'll take another agent without any fuss, I imagine."</p>

<p>"No doubt of it," Grady said. "Can't say I'm glad to leave, though. It
was a good place."</p>

<p>"I still don't get it," the mate said. "We came in and found you in the
agency, out cold with coca. The door was down, and arrows all over the
place. Why didn't they come in and dig a knife into you?"</p>

<p>"Customs and taboos," Grady said. "I took a chance on it, but I was
pretty sure I was right. Common sense—by their standards. Man's
asleep—his ghost is walking around. If you kill him in his sleep, you
free his ghost, which is very bad, very strong magic. So you have to
wake him up to kill him. And they couldn't wake me up; I was full of
that coca leaf, enough for a week."

1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>
<div>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>
<div>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>
<blockquote>

    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms

    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>
<div>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>
<div>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official

to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<ul>
    <li>• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has

        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    </li>
    <li>• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    </li>
    <li>• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.

1.F.
</div>
<div>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>
<div>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>
<div>

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div>
<div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>
<div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
</div>
<div class='secthead'>

</div>
<div class='secthead'>
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>
<div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>
<div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>
<div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>
<div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>
<div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

<div class='secthead'>
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div>
<div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>
<div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
<div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>
<div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
